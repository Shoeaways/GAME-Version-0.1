## Prerequisites
In order to use this code at the moment, you will have to set up SFML 2.5.1 or the current updated version.

### Windows

- [SFML 2.5.1 - GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (DW2) 32-bit (for Windows)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-32-bit.zip)
- [GCC 7.3.0 MinGW (DW2) 32-bit (for Windows)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-7.3.0-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download)
- [Git Bash (for Windows) ](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### MacOS

- [SFML 2.5.1 - Clang 64-bit](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-macOS-clang.tar.gz)
- Command Line Tools / XCode (type "xcode-select --install" in terminal to trigger the installer)

### Linux

- Get SFML 2.5.1 from your distro if it has it, or compile from source

### All

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Extensions (install from Extensions panel):
  - [Official C/C++ Extension (0.21.0+)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
  - [Shader languages support for VS Code (Optional Syntax Highlighting)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader)
  - [x86 and x86_64 Assembly (Optional Syntax Highlighting)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=13xforever.language-x86-64-assembly)

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download & Extract SFML to **C:/SFML-2.5.1/** where the bin/lib/include folders are contained within
2. Download & Extract MinGW to **C:/mingw32/** where the bin/lib/include folders are contained within

### MacOS

1. Install "Command Line Tools" in MacOS if they're not already installed (type "xcode-select --install" in terminal)
2. Follow the "Installing SFML" directions here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-osx.php#installing-sfml

### Linux

1. Ensure the GCC Toolchain is installed (**sudo apt install build-essential**) (**sudo pacman -S base-devel**)
2. Install libsfml (**sudo apt install libsfml-dev**) (**sudo pacman -S sfml**). The SFML version you got will vary depending on the distro. 2.5.1 is included in [Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/HEADER.html) for example.

### All

3. Download & Install Visual Studio Code if you don't already have it.
4. Install the official **C/C++** Extension, reload the window & wait for the dependencies to install.
5. If on Windows, install **Git Bash**, and ensure the **"terminal.integrated.shell.windows"** property in the project's **settings.json** is set to **bash.exe**'s correct location (default: C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe). We'll be using this for the terminal in our workspace so that the Makefile can run in both Windows, Mac & Linux
6. In **settings.json** Ensure **Path** in the **terminal.integrated.env.windows** object is set to the correct location of the compiler's executable (example: C:\\mingw32\\bin) and the SFML directory is correct as well. Keep in mind Paths should be separated by a semi-colon with no spaces between.

**Note:** You can manage the "Path" environment variable from Windows if you'd like, but I've found sandboxing it in VS Code is better for tracking things like .dll dependencies.
